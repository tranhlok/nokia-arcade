CS111 Final Project
This is an old copy of my first ever CS project.
- Purpose: I want to do something fun with my final project.
- Background: For this final project, I will do something different from what we have done
in class. I’m not fascinated with data, graph or any kind of science – biology, chemistry,
physics – related models and numbers, but I really like to play games and want to learn
how to make one for myself. So I looking for some article about how to make game with
python (the program language that we have learnt about in this intro class) and I found
a library called pygame that can helps me create some simple old-school 90s like games.
I want to create something common, something that recalls the childhood memories
about games of everybody. I started to think about what game I play the most back in
that time and I immediately think about my dad’s old Nokia cellphone that has all the
coolest game at that time, including Snake and Ping Pong.
- The problem is interesting because it is exactly what I wanted to do in the future: A
game designer.
